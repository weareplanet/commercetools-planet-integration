export { default as allOperationHandler }  from './all-operations-handler';

// Other lower-level handlers (from `per-operation-handlers` directory) can be exported here in case of necessity - for example:
// export { default as createPaymentHandler }  from './per-operation-handlers/create-payment';
// but that is not needed acccording to the MVP's single-function design.

## Introduction

We built this connector so that you can quickly integrate your payment flows to Planet. The connector links to the Datatrans Gateway (owned by Planet) and will automatically feed valuable payment data to your commercetools environment. We built this connector with guidance from commercetools experts. We will continue to maintain this connector to support updates by commercetools constantly. To use the planet connector, you will require an existing commercetools environment and a Datatrans account. To proceed with real payments, you will need a production account at Datatrans.

Add this connector to an existing environment or create a dedicated space in the cloud (e.g., AWS, GCP). Setup one connector for many projects or set up one for each of your projects.

## Connector Overview

The connector is a module you need to install on your preferred environment that will handle the API calls to Datatrans for you and ultimately update your commercetools project with relevant transaction data whenever your customer has completed a payment.

![Overview](docs/img/overview.png)

You will need the following to complete the integration:

* Datatrans: An active Datatrans merchant account and a merchantId
* commercetools: A commercetools account
* On-premise or cloud environment: Access to an on-premise environment, AWS, or GCP space to deploy the connector and let it do the magic for you

Next, we'll cover the features available with our connector.

## Features

We currently support the most requested features from past interactions with commercetools merchants. If you are missing an important feature, feel free to [reach out to us](https://www.datatrans.ch/contact).

### Redirect & Lightbox

Redirect your customer's payments to Datatrans payment pages and shift any developments related to third-party providers to our gateway. We take care of all the necessary redirects. After your customer completes a transaction, we redirect them to your defined success, cancel, or error URL. All necessary information from the transaction, including the saved card information, is fed to commercetools. Besides a full redirect, we also allow you to show our payment pages as an overlay on your website. This overlay method is called Lightbox and helps you keep your UI in the background. Read more on the Datatrans documentation page [Redirect & Lightbox](https://docs.datatrans.ch/docs/redirect-lightbox).

### Tokenization

Save your loyal customers' payment information securely and in a PCI-compliant way in the background as a token (aka alias) to make follow-up purchases or one-click checkouts available. The connector currently supports tokenization for card payments only. You can choose to only save tokens for specific customers (e.g., registered users) or anybody. Read more on our dedicated documentation page [Tokenization](https://docs.datatrans.ch/docs/tokenization).

### All the Payment Methods You Need

The connector should work with any payment method that can be processed via the Redirect & Lightbox integration. So far, however, we officially support the following payment methods:

* Cards: MasterCard, Visa, American Express, China Union Pay, Diners, Discover, JCB, Maestro, Dankort
* Wallets: Apple Pay, Google Pay (Apple Pay is only supported via Redirect)
* Alternative Payment Methods: Giropay, iDEAL, PayPal, Paysafecard, PostFinance Card, Samsung Pay, SEPA, Twint

All payment methods supported by Datatrans are listed [here](https://docs.datatrans.ch/docs/payment-methods).

### Notification Module

The connector provides a notification module that is asynchronously fed by the Datatrans gateway. You won't need to do manual actions - the connector picks up important payment information and adds it automatically to commercetools objects.

## Next Steps

Now that you know how the integration will work and its available features, you may proceed with the integration.
